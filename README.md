The material for the R/Pharma workshop about end to end clinical trial
reporting.

In this 2-day workshop you will be working with the Tidyverse and the
first generation of Pharmaverse tools in order to \'deliver\' typical
clinical trial displays. Going from SDTM all the way through to table
generation. Specifically, we will walk through an end-to-end focusing on
a sample of demographic, safety and efficacy summaries. We will also be
using analysis results datasets (ARDs), which are the newly proposed
CDSIC data standard, showing how they can be in cooperated into a
clinical workflow.
